Android vs. iOS
Insight: Although iOS users represent only 10% of the user base, they contribute 35% of total spending.
Recommendation: Increase focus on iOS user acquisition and retention strategies, as they are highly valuable despite their smaller numbers.
Insight: Android users tend to spend more when their interaction frequency is between 80 to 100, while iOS users spend more between 10 to 30 frequencies.
Recommendation: Create and launch frequency-specific promotions. For Android users, design offers and notifications that encourage sustained engagement, aiming to boost interactions into the 80-100 range. For iOS users, focus on enhancing the value proposition early in their user journey to capitalize on their spending habits between 10-30 interactions.

 Spending in details 

Insight: The majority of users spend money primarily on purchasing virtual gold, which they then use for boosting activities.
Recommendation: Enhance the user experience around virtual gold purchases by offering bundled deals, discounts on bulk purchases, and limited-time offers. Additionally, improve and expand the boosting features to provide more value, variety, and exclusive benefits, encouraging users to spend more gold.

Insight: Periodic data is currently unavailable, hindering the ability to conduct accurate monthly analyses.
Recommendation: Establish a system for regular data collection and automation, ensuring that key metrics are captured and stored consistently. Invest in tools or platforms that can automate this process, minimizing manual effort and reducing the risk of data gaps.

Game Modes
Insight: Gamers who play Match C tend to spend more money compared to other modes, likely due to the lower presence of bots, which enhances the gaming experience.
Recommendation: Increase promotion and visibility of Match C through targeted marketing campaigns, in-game notifications, and incentives to encourage more players to engage with this mode. Additionally, consider further refining Match C to maintain or reduce the presence of bots, enhancing the user experience and driving higher spending.
Temporarily holding Match B can free up resources and attention to create engaging activities around both Match A and B, potentially boosting overall player engagement and revenue. 
Insight: Properly storing and organizing data in relation to game type and purchasing behaviour will provide a comprehensive understanding of player preferences and spending patterns.
Recommendation: Develop and deploy a robust data storage and management system that categorizes and tracks purchasing behavior by game type. This will enable more precise analysis and better-informed decision-making regarding game development, marketing, and monetization strategies.
