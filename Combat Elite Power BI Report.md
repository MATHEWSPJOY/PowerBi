## Introduction

Combat Elite is a multiplayer game featuring 4-player matches where players can compete against others or bots. The game offers three types of matches in a rotating cycle and provides various in-app purchases (IAPs) as well as virtual currency, Gold, which can be used for purchasing boosts and other in-game benefits.

## Insights and Recommendations

### 1. Android vs. iOS Spending Patterns

**Insight**:
- iOS users represent 10% of the user base but contribute 35% of total spending.
- Android users spend more when their interaction frequency is between 80 to 100, while iOS users spend more between 10 to 30 frequencies.

**Recommendations**:
- **iOS**: Increase focus on user acquisition and retention strategies specifically for iOS users, leveraging their higher spending propensity.
- **Android**: Develop and launch frequency-specific promotions. Encourage sustained engagement with targeted offers for Android users to reach the 80-100 interaction range. For iOS users, enhance early-stage value propositions to capitalize on their spending habits between 10-30 interactions.

### 2. Spending on Virtual Gold and Boosting

**Insight**:
- Users predominantly spend on purchasing virtual gold, which is then used for boosting activities.

**Recommendations**:
- Enhance the virtual gold purchase experience with bundled deals, discounts on bulk purchases, and limited-time offers.
- Improve and expand boosting features to offer greater value, variety, and exclusive benefits, thereby encouraging higher expenditure on gold.

### 3. Data Collection and Automation

**Insight**:
- Current periodic data collection is inadequate for conducting accurate monthly analyses.

**Recommendations**:
- Establish a robust data collection and automation system to ensure consistent capture and storage of key metrics.
- Invest in tools or platforms for automating data collection to minimize manual effort and mitigate the risk of data gaps.

### 4. Game Mode Engagement

**Insight**:
- Players who engage in Match C tend to spend more due to a lower presence of bots, enhancing their gaming experience.
- Temporarily holding Match B can allow for better resource allocation and creation of engaging activities for Matches A and B.

**Recommendations**:
- Promote Match C through targeted marketing campaigns, in-game notifications, and incentives to boost player engagement and spending.
- Hold Match B temporarily to focus on enhancing and promoting Matches A and B, potentially increasing overall player engagement and revenue.

### 5. Data Storage and Analysis

**Insight**:
- Properly storing and organizing data related to game type and purchasing behavior is essential for comprehensive analysis.

**Recommendations**:
- Develop and deploy a robust data storage and management system that categorizes and tracks purchasing behavior by game type.
- This system will facilitate precise analysis and better-informed decision-making for game development, marketing, and monetization strategies.
